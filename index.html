    <h4>Well we can technically split the National US Voting System 3 cateogries</h4>

    <li class=VotingList>
      <p>Voting for Local Representitives</p>
      <p>Voting for Senators</p>
      <p>Voting for the President</p>
    </li>

    <h4>I'll be going into each one in depth in the following sections</h4>

  <br></br>
  <div class=LclRep>
    <h1>Voting for your Local Representive</h1>
    <p>Voting for your local representative is essential as they represent you and your local community directly.
      Regional Representatives are assigned based on what district you are located in (find more about what district you
      are in below), there are in total of 435 representatives, and they are elected every 2 years and will represent
      you and your district</p>

  <div class="Senator">
    <h1>Voting for Senator</h1>
    <p>Voting for Senator works similarly to voting for a representative as they both have terms of 2 years, however
      unlike your representatives who represent your local district, the Senator represents the state as a who in the US
      Senate. There are 100 senators, 2 for each state in the US. </p>

  </div>

  <div class="President">
    <h1>Voting for President</h1>
    <p>Now it's time for the more well know part of US democracy out of the 3, voting for President. As most of you
      know, citizens of the US vote every 4 years for President, unlike both the US House of Representatives and Senate,
      which declare winners based on popular vote (how many people of a population voted for one specific candidate over
      the other). The US President is voted based on a system called the Electoral College. This system gives a state a
      certain number of points (electors) based on their state's population. This means that a big state like New York,
      with 16 million people currently living in it, won't have the same points as a small state like Wyoming, which
      only has 500 thousand people living there. In November, everyone votes in the "General Election," and people from
      each state vote on who they want to become President. Whoever has the most votes in each state would win that
      state, giving them that state's number of points. In the end, whoever gets the highest score (or passes 270
      points) would win the election and become President of the United States.</p>
